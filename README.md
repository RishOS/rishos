# RishOS

**RishOS** is an **open-source, borderless operating system**.  
The vision: **run any file, from Windows, macOS, or Linux, from a single platform** — no walls, no friction.  

On top of this foundation, rishOS will ship with a built-in **AI Copilot** (powered by open-source models like LLaMA and beyond) to help users:  
- ⚡ Interact naturally (chat, casual, or technical)  
- 📚 Write and improve documentation  
- 💻 Generate, review, and debug code  

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This project is still in its **early stages**.  
- Core OS architecture is under design.  
- AI Copilot integration is exploratory.  
- We’re mapping the community-driven roadmap.  

We need **collaborators, dreamers, and builders** to help bring this vision alive.  

---

## 🌍 Mission
- Create a **borderless OS** that unifies all file ecosystems (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
- Build an **AI-first experience** that feels native, not bolted-on  
- Keep everything **100% open-source** and **community-driven**  

---

## 🚀 Goals
1. Build the foundation of a **borderless OS** with seamless file compatibility.  
2. Integrate an **AI Copilot** to assist creators, developers, and everyday users.  
3. Create a transparent roadmap shaped by contributors.  
4. Ensure **performance, clarity, and openness** at every layer.

## 🛠️ Planned Features
- **Universal file support** across major OS ecosystems  
- **AI Copilot** with:  
  - Conversational assistance (fun + technical)  
  - Documentation & writing help  
  - Clean, structured code generation/debugging  
- **Developer APIs** (FastAPI-based local API layer)  
- Community-first roadmap with issue tracking + discussions
